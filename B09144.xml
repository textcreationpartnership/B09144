            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>COncerning thoÅ¿e Brief and Nervous DiÅ¿courÅ¿es which are emitted here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, the Reverend and Worthy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, had no thoughts of PubliÅ¿hing them, until Å¿uch time as others did Importune him thereunto. As for the firÅ¿t TreatiÅ¿e, it was thus occaÅ¿ioned.</p>
            <p>In the diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ing time of the late War with the <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>N-England,</hi> many of the Rulers (both Civil and EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tical) in <hi>Connecticut Colony,</hi> being Å¿enÅ¿ible that publick Judgements Å¿eldome come, but as Intimations of Heavens diÅ¿plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure; and that then, of all Men the Leaders of the People are concerned to enquire into the CauÅ¿es of the Lords ControverÅ¿ie, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1. they did accordingly meet for that purpoÅ¿e. The MiniÅ¿ters drew up in writing what they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be the mind of God, reÅ¿pecting the Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn QueÅ¿tion before them; which <hi>ReÅ¿ult,</hi> was approved of by their MagiÅ¿trates, and Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the ConÅ¿ideration of the Inhabitants in that JuriÅ¿diction. This faithful Servant of ChriÅ¿t, did wifely take hold on that opportunity,
<pb facs="tcp:191877:5"/>in his publick MiniÅ¿try to inÅ¿iÅ¿t upon both the <hi>Malady</hi> and the <hi>Remedy,</hi> which there is Å¿o great cauÅ¿e to be enquiring into, and did reduce his InÅ¿tructions into a <hi>Catechetical Method,</hi> for the better edification of the younger Å¿ort in his Congregation. Sundry PerÅ¿ons of Worth and Judgement hapning to be preÅ¿ent at Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e ExerciÅ¿es, were very earneÅ¿t to have them made more publick; to gratifie whoÅ¿e deÅ¿ires, the Worthy <hi>Author</hi> has been prevailed with to grant the Copy of what was more inlargedly <hi>viva voce,</hi> delivered. A DiÅ¿courÅ¿e of this nature is very Å¿eaÅ¿onable and needful; and I hope will be bleÅ¿Å¿ed for the good of many.</p>
            <p>As for the Å¿mall tractate, reÅ¿pecting the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tian Sabbath;</hi> the Author has (Å¿o far as I am able to diÅ¿cern) with very good judgement and in few words, aÅ¿Å¿erted and proved the Truth whoÅ¿e confirmation he has undertaken. The moÅ¿t plauÅ¿ible Argument, which our <hi>JewiÅ¿h Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batarians</hi> inÅ¿iÅ¿t upon is, their pretending the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the fourth Commandment. Nor do we deny but that by virtue thereof, a <hi>Å¿eventh part of time,</hi> or one day in the <hi>Hebdomadel Revolution,</hi> ought to be kept as an holy ReÅ¿t unto God. But it is evident, that Å¿ome expreÅ¿Å¿ions in the <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi> do in a peculiar manner reÅ¿pect the <hi>JewiÅ¿h State.</hi> This is true of the Preface to the Moral
<pb facs="tcp:191877:5"/>Law; and of the promiÅ¿e annexed to the fifth Commandment; and Å¿ome particulars in the tenth Commandment, are accommodated to the then Å¿tate of <hi>IÅ¿rael.</hi> And why Å¿ome ExpreÅ¿Å¿ions in the fourth Commandment may not be Å¿o too, our Å¿eventh day Men have as yet given us no Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and Å¿ufficient reaÅ¿on. Nay, the Learned <hi>Jews</hi> themÅ¿elves acknowledge it to be Å¿o. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not offended when they Å¿ee Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tians doing Å¿ervile works upon the Å¿eventh day of the week, for they Å¿ay the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to the Å¿trict and legal obÅ¿ervation of their Sabbath. The Jews in <hi>AmÅ¿terdam</hi> told <hi>JackÅ¿on, Sands,</hi> and other keepers of the Å¿eventh day, that except they were alÅ¿o CircumciÅ¿ed, their obÅ¿ervation of that day was groundleÅ¿s. There is no place in the New TeÅ¿tament which the <hi>Iews</hi> do Å¿o much object againÅ¿t ChriÅ¿tians as <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17, 18. They perverÅ¿ely cavil and Å¿ay, that the ApoÅ¿tles did act contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of their MaÅ¿ter ChriÅ¿t, by telling Men that they ought not to obÅ¿erve the Ceremonial Law, <hi>R. Maimon</hi> (<hi>In miÅ¿na</hi> L. 1. C. 9.) has a whole Chapter full of BlaÅ¿phemy againÅ¿t thoÅ¿e who teach that the Law is deÅ¿troyed in whole or in part. The moÅ¿t Judicious and Learned of our Writers, acknowledge that the place mentioned has reÅ¿pect both to the Ceremonial and to the
<pb facs="tcp:191877:6"/>Moral Law; And that as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap> is Å¿et in opppoÅ¿ition <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap> as deÅ¿troying is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ite to fulfilling, chriÅ¿t did not evert the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law. he did himÅ¿elf conform to the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the law, and require other men to do Å¿o, as long as the author of that law did Å¿ee meet to continue it; and every way fulfilled thoÅ¿e <hi>Types</hi> which pointed at the <hi>MeÅ¿Å¿iah</hi> that was to come. Our <hi>IewiÅ¿h Sabbatarians</hi> who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buÅ¿e thoÅ¿e words of ChriÅ¿t to countenance their Error; might as well from thence argue that the Ceremonial Law is Å¿till in force. For its certain it was not aboliÅ¿hed until every tittle contained therein was fulfilled. It has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that ChriÅ¿tians in the Primitive times ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erved the Å¿eventh day. The ChriÅ¿tian <hi>Iews</hi> in the ApoÅ¿tles time had a religious reÅ¿pect, not only for the Å¿eventh day Sabbath, but for Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciÅ¿ion and other Ceremonies, until Å¿uch time as the <hi>Iudaical World</hi> was utterly deÅ¿troyed, but the ApoÅ¿tles never allowed ChriÅ¿tianized Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles Å¿o to <hi>Iudaize.</hi> The <hi>Ebionites</hi> kept the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, but they were never accounted true ChriÅ¿tians. The <hi>ConÅ¿titutions</hi> which paÅ¿s under the Name of <hi>Clement,</hi> L 7. C. 24. commend the obÅ¿ervation both of the Å¿eventh and of the firÅ¿t day of the week. And <hi>EuÅ¿ebius</hi> Å¿peaks of Å¿ome that obÅ¿erved both dayes. Such ChriÅ¿tians
<pb facs="tcp:191877:6"/>were certainly leavened with <hi>IudaiÅ¿m.</hi> At this day, the <hi>AbyÅ¿Å¿ine</hi> ChriÅ¿tians obÅ¿erve the Å¿eventh day, they alÅ¿o obÅ¿erve CircumciÅ¿ion; and if Men will <hi>Iudaize</hi> in one particular, it is not to to be wondred at, if they be left to <hi>Iudaize</hi> in more. Of later times there have not been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of any great Fame or Note in the World, that have Å¿tood up for this Opinion. There was in <hi>England</hi> formerly <hi>Braborn</hi> and <hi>Trask;</hi> but they afterwards recanted. Within theÅ¿e few years, Mr. <hi>Bramfield</hi> of <hi>Sherborn</hi> was Å¿trangely drawn away into this Error. But his weightieÅ¿t Objections are anÅ¿wered, with great judgment and candour, by the Reverend Mr. <hi>William Ben</hi> of <hi>DorcheÅ¿ter</hi> in <hi>DorÅ¿et</hi> (a Man whoÅ¿e Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion was occaÅ¿ioned by a Sermon of his own; after which he continued an eminent Light in the Church of God for fifty years together; and than whom I never knew Man upon Earth that did maintain a greater intimacy of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God) Nor has Mr. <hi>Bramfield</hi> made any Reply to Mr. <hi>Ben</hi>'s Book, Å¿o far as I have Å¿een or heard.</p>
            <p>As for the preÅ¿ent <hi>JewiÅ¿h Sabbatarians</hi> in <hi>Connecticut Colony</hi> they out-do all their PredeceÅ¿Å¿ors, as to InÅ¿olent Behaviour, being arrived unto that height of impudent ProphaneneÅ¿s, that they fear not in the Å¿ight of the Sun, to bid defiance unto the ChriÅ¿tian Sabbath, by following the Å¿ervile works of their particular Callings on the Lords Day.

            <p>Concerning the Objector here Animadverted upon; the truth is, his Allegations are feeble and frivolous, Å¿o that Å¿ome may think 'tis pity a Man of Mr. <hi>Fitch</hi>'s Strength and Ability, Å¿hould be improved in a Service which a far meaner hand might with eaÅ¿e have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.

                  <head>In Order to Å¿ome <hi>Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Solemn Advice, which our Honoured MagiÅ¿trates did in the Time of our Calamity, Å¿end abroad unto the Å¿everal Churches and Congregations in this Colony, we have occaÅ¿ion to reflect upon both</head>
                  <p>THe Provocations of <hi>New-England,</hi> and the Impediments of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and to make way for the following DiÅ¿courÅ¿e: we may conÅ¿ider what <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> that great Prophet of the Lord, and chief Ruler in <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> did incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate upon that People in <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.7. <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and forget not how thou provokedÅ¿t the Lord thy God to wrath in the WilderneÅ¿s.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ought to have and hold a remembrance what our TranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ions have been, by which the Lord hath been provoked to wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Remembrance ought to be clear and full: the Pen-men of the Holy Scriptures
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:191877:8"/>were moved by the Spirit of God, to Record clearly and fully the Provocations of which the People of God had been guilty, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeÅ¿t in <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 78. <hi>&amp; PÅ¿al.</hi> 106. and through the HiÅ¿tory of the Church in the Book of God, and Å¿ome of the Å¿pots of the moÅ¿t beautiful Saints, God would not Å¿uffer theÅ¿e to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and left out of the Holy Scripture Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, 1 <hi>King</hi> 15.5. <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 106.32, 32.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Remembrance ought to be affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate, with a heart Å¿uitably affected; Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring what our cares and fears, grief and tears were in that day, when the wrath of the Lord appeared to be a conÅ¿uming fire, and we as combuÅ¿tible matter; and had not the Lord quenched the fire of his wrath, with his own Bowels of Mercies, we had periÅ¿hed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16 61. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.19, 20.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Remembrance ought to be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly Reforming, conÅ¿idering how our Å¿ins have driven us into a perillous Å¿tate, and we ready to periÅ¿h in the Ocean of miÅ¿eries, and Å¿hall we again provoke the Lord to wrath? will he not be angry until he hath conÅ¿umed us? <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.14. if we do not remember our Provocations to our Humiliation and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the Lord will remember them againÅ¿t us, to our own confuÅ¿ion and deÅ¿truction; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:191877:8"/>we waÅ¿h our Å¿elves as with Nitre, and take much Sope, yet our iniquities are marked before the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.22. <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 50.21, 22.</p>
                  <p>And we may Å¿ee what Record of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences reÅ¿pecting a People or particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons is moÅ¿t agreeable to holy Scripture Rule. That Record which doth declare the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous acts of the Lord &amp; our unrighteous deeds, the Å¿uperabounding Grace of God although our Å¿ins have abounded: That Record which doth Å¿et forth the Lords JuÅ¿tice, Mercy, Truth, FaithfulneÅ¿s and Almighty arm, by uncovering the feebleneÅ¿s, Å¿ickleneÅ¿s, falÅ¿eneÅ¿s, &amp; many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bitter Provocations, both of Rulers &amp; peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.7, 8. This is moÅ¿t like the Record in Holy Scripture, and the Church HiÅ¿tory therein contained: but Å¿uch a faithful Record Å¿eldom comes forth in that age in which the then preÅ¿ent Providences were acted, few will Å¿uffer a plain Remembrance of their Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, but the Lord hath hitherto provided Å¿ome faithful Recorder, who hath left that in Record to Å¿ucceeding Ages, which the preÅ¿ent Generation would not endure to hear of, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 10.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.5. <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 78.36, 37, 38.</p>
                  <p>And that we may have and hold a convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, hearty &amp; Reforming effectual Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance what our Provocations have been; let
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:191877:9"/>us conÅ¿ider according to that moÅ¿t Solemn Advice of our Rulers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> What that Å¿in is which is the root actually and nextly of all the other Å¿ins?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An.</hi> ApoÅ¿taÅ¿ie from the true Religion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idered not only abÅ¿olutely but comparatively as it is a declenÅ¿ion from the Å¿tricter part of Religion, or a decay of the Beauty of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ProfeÅ¿Å¿ion, and this ApoÅ¿tacy doth Å¿hew it Å¿elf in the various degrees of it, and in the bitter fruits and effects of the Å¿ame.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. ApoÅ¿taÅ¿ie may be taken either AbÅ¿olute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or Comparatively. 1. AbÅ¿olutely, and Å¿o its a total turning from the Faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19, 20. and thus the ApoÅ¿tate is become a BlaÅ¿pheming Infidel; or a falling from ProfeÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ProphaneneÅ¿s; &amp; thus the ApoÅ¿tate is turn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed like the Dog to his Vomit, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22, or a forÅ¿aking all GodlineÅ¿s, and godly wayes, and loving the preÅ¿ent World; and thus the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tate is become a meer Worldling, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or ApoÅ¿taÅ¿ie taken Comparatively.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In compariÅ¿on of that which theÅ¿e Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ors have been and done, and thus they are not the lovers of God, and doers of good works, which Å¿ometimes formerly they have been, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4 5.</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:191877:9"/>
                  <p n="2">2. Fallen away in compariÅ¿on of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of their godly PredeceÅ¿Å¿ors, whoÅ¿e Children they are after the FleÅ¿h, but not after the Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.37.44. a noble Vine, and right Seed in reÅ¿pect of their Parentage, but a degenerate Plant in reÅ¿pect of their own practice, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.21. and have gone away from the Ordinances of the Lord, from the dayes of their Fathers, and not kept them in that purity and power, as they were left with them by their PredeceÅ¿Å¿ors, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.7.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In compariÅ¿on of what they yet profeÅ¿s in words to be, but compare their words, and their works, and it is manifeÅ¿t that their works do deny what in words they profeÅ¿s, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16 concerning that abÅ¿olute ApoÅ¿taÅ¿ie, it is not Å¿een in many in <hi>New-England,</hi> nor uÅ¿ually Å¿een in any, unleÅ¿s it be in Å¿ome who at firÅ¿t are left to Doctrinal ProphaneneÅ¿s, by falling into damnable HereÅ¿ies, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. and are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards given up to practical ProphaneneÅ¿s, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and AtheiÅ¿m: But as to this compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and gradual ApoÅ¿taÅ¿ie, how far <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> is declined from being <hi>New-England,</hi> I muÅ¿t leave to the wiÅ¿e hearted to judge, and thoÅ¿e only are beÅ¿t able to judge of this, who are kept in an awakened broken-hearted, and humbly-believing frame, by frequent heart-Å¿earching
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:191877:10"/>and Å¿elf-emptying tryals.</p>
                  <p>And this comparative ApoÅ¿taÅ¿ie doth appear.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In DeclenÅ¿ion from the Å¿tricter part of Religion: an apoÅ¿tatizing ProfeÅ¿Å¿or in his conÅ¿ultations and contrivements, will chuÅ¿e the licencing part of that inÅ¿truction given by ChriÅ¿t, to be wiÅ¿e as Serpents, but he refuÅ¿eth that reÅ¿trictive part to be harmleÅ¿s as Doves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.16. but happy is he who is harmleÅ¿ly wiÅ¿e, and yet wiÅ¿ely harmleÅ¿s. An ApoÅ¿tati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Church is intenÅ¿ely Å¿et to the extenÅ¿ion of Church Liberties to the utmoÅ¿t extremity of them, that is the licencing part, but will be remiÅ¿s in the exerciÅ¿e of Church DiÅ¿cipline, and to keep the difference clear between the clean and the unclean, that is the Å¿tricter part of Religion, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.26. An ApoÅ¿tatizing ProfeÅ¿Å¿or will catch at ChriÅ¿tian Liberty to pleaÅ¿e the fleÅ¿h, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.13. but will not Å¿it as with a knife at his Throat, as the wiÅ¿dome of the Spirit of God doth warn in that matter him who is given to appetite, or any Å¿enÅ¿ual affection; this is the Å¿tricter part of Religion, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.2. A withering ProfeÅ¿Å¿or in the midÅ¿t of all his ApoÅ¿tatizing and degenerate PractiÅ¿es wanteth not wit, nor will, zeal nor courage, to do Å¿ome duties in which he can
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:191877:10"/>pacifie ConÅ¿cience and pleaÅ¿e corruption, can honour God and exalt himÅ¿elf, and be as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim,</hi> like the Heifer that loveth to tread out the Corn, <hi>HoÅ¿.</hi> 10.11. But as to thoÅ¿e Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in which there muÅ¿t be a crucifying of the fleÅ¿h and the affections, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. and an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilating the idol Å¿elf, and that the caÅ¿ting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Å¿elf, Å¿hall be the way to Å¿ave himÅ¿elf, and the hating of life Å¿hall be the only way to keep it to life eternal. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.25. whatever a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ConÅ¿cience may tell an ApoÅ¿tatizing ProfeÅ¿Å¿or of the truth of theÅ¿e things, yet an unbelieving and backfliding heart will draw back, for he loveth pleaÅ¿ures more than to pleaÅ¿e God, and the praiÅ¿e of Men more than the praiÅ¿e of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.42, 43. and thus the declenÅ¿ion is from the Å¿tricter part of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or a decay of the beauty of a religious ProfeÅ¿Å¿ion, and this is uÅ¿ually Å¿een:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Either in a palpable neglect of Å¿ome known duty, in which it may be Å¿aid of him, <hi>thou lackeÅ¿t one thing,</hi> Mark 10.21. and is as the deficiency or want of Å¿ome part and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the body which marreth the integrity and compleatneÅ¿s of the Man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or Å¿ome notorious diÅ¿ordering and diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing of duties, that one Å¿ervice comes in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:191877:11"/>the time and place of another, and not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is comely, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.35. and this is as a member of the Body out of its proper place, and a want of that beautiful and joyful thing called Order, <hi>Col.</hi> 2, 5.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Or a greatning and heightening the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect unto Å¿ome leÅ¿Å¿er duties, but a neglecting and not having a proportionable regard to the greater duties, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.23. and this is as the exceÅ¿Å¿ive greatneÅ¿s of a Member above its natural proportion.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Or a want of that true, godly, amiable countenance, with which a Service Å¿hould Å¿hine, that mixture of a true GoÅ¿pel, white and ruddy Complexion, which is made up of a temperate mixture of divers Graces at once manifeÅ¿t, and may be compared to the Mirrh with the Spice, the Wine with the Milk, <hi>Can.</hi> 5.1. But a declining ProfeÅ¿Å¿or is either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diÅ¿creetly zealous, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2. or luke warm, neither hot nor cold, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.16. he is either SchiÅ¿matically cenÅ¿orious, and Å¿aith, <hi>Stand by, I am holier than you, IÅ¿ai.</hi> 65.5. or is Å¿o promiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouÅ¿ly temporizing, that he is mixed among the People, and as a Cake not turned, <hi>HoÅ¿ea</hi> 7.8.</p>
                  <p>The ConcluÅ¿ion of this is, that the Lord in judgement doth withhold from ApoÅ¿tatizing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:191877:11"/>ProfeÅ¿Å¿ors, thoÅ¿e beautiful viÅ¿ions, and tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming DiÅ¿coveries of his Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. he doth withdraw the riÅ¿ing Beams of the Sun of RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, and the Å¿hadows of the Evening are Å¿tretched upon them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.4 5. and the temptations of Satan, and the World doth look upon them, and make them Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnt, and Black, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.6. and the Beauty of their viÅ¿ible ProfeÅ¿Å¿ion, doth languiÅ¿h as with pining Å¿ickneÅ¿s, their love decayeth and waxeth cold, and iniquity aboundeth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.12. and if there yet remain Å¿ome good things with an ApoÅ¿tatizing People, <hi>yet how is the Gold become dim,</hi> Lam. 4.1. their ProfeÅ¿Å¿ion hath loÅ¿t much of that golden Å¿plendor and precious and pleaÅ¿ant luÅ¿tre. And thus Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tacy conÅ¿idered as a decay of the beauty of a religious ProfeÅ¿Å¿ion, and this maketh way for the clearing of the ReaÅ¿on, why ApoÅ¿taÅ¿ie is the root of other Å¿ins; and that is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. BecauÅ¿e other Å¿ins in nature follow this, and they are as branches or bitter fruits: the Å¿in of omiÅ¿Å¿ion, is in nature before the Å¿in of commiÅ¿Å¿ion; a neglect of what ought to be done, before the practice of that which ought not to be done; a forÅ¿aking the Fountain of living Waters, and then follows, <hi>our hewing CiÅ¿terns, broken CiÅ¿terns which can hold no Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> Jer. 2.13.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:191877:12"/>
                  <p n="2">2. The other Å¿ins are (through the Lords juÅ¿t judgement) a puniÅ¿hment of the former. ApoÅ¿taÅ¿ie, is puniÅ¿hed with many vices, that where ApoÅ¿taÅ¿ie comes in, behold a troop of other Å¿ins follow, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 81.11, 12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.24, 25. But of this in that which followeth.</p>
                  <p>Thus ApoÅ¿taÅ¿ie hath been conÅ¿idered in the kind quality of it: Now in the next place we may Å¿ee how it Å¿hews it Å¿elf in the degrees of it.</p>
                  <p>The QueÅ¿tion is, <hi>What are thoÅ¿e degrees and Å¿teps in which this ApoÅ¿taÅ¿ie doth Å¿hew it Å¿elf?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>AnÅ¿.</hi> ApoÅ¿taÅ¿ie doth Å¿hew it Å¿elf in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Å¿everal Duties of Gods WorÅ¿hip, or of Family Duties, or private ChriÅ¿tian Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and at laÅ¿t in the neglect of the Publick WorÅ¿hip of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. ApoÅ¿taÅ¿ie beginneth in Å¿ecret, in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Å¿ecret Prayer, that which is called clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿et Prayer, or praying alone, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.6. or in the neglect of Å¿elf examination; that which is called a judging a Mans Å¿elf. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31. to judge our Å¿tate whether it be happy or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erable, to judge our daily way and particular actions, whether they be good or evil, and to this is requiÅ¿ite Å¿ome convenient Å¿eaÅ¿on daily, and a ConÅ¿cience and Heart awakened to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the timely way of Self examination,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:191877:12"/>
                     <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.40. <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6. And the neglect of theÅ¿e Duties is, either total, as thoÅ¿e who have caÅ¿t off Å¿ecret Prayer, and Self-examination, and do neglect any Å¿et, Å¿olemn and Å¿teady atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to theÅ¿e duties, <hi>Job</hi> 15.9. unleÅ¿s it be in Å¿ome fit of diÅ¿treÅ¿s, and then they cry to God, and Å¿ay, <hi>AriÅ¿e and Å¿ave us,</hi> Jer. 2.27.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or if they do daily attend to theÅ¿e Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and yet neglect that which is of moÅ¿t per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿onal and Å¿pecial concernment to their own Souls; you may be in a Å¿ecret place with a Friend, and have much diÅ¿courÅ¿e, and that in Å¿ecret, and yet not one word of Å¿ecret things, but that which any one may hear: likewiÅ¿e, you may be in prayer alone in Å¿ecret, and yet not one word of that which is of moÅ¿t Å¿ecret concernment to your Soul, but that which may be expreÅ¿t before a Family or a Congregation; and thus one principal end of Secret Prayer is loÅ¿t, which reÅ¿pecteth the ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿ecret Å¿ins, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 19.12. and the petitioning for thoÅ¿e perÅ¿onal and Å¿ecret favours which may not Å¿o conveniently be expreÅ¿t before others, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 38.9. But the Å¿pecialty intended in the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this, is to Å¿hew how far the neglect of theÅ¿e Å¿ecret Duties doth argue a declenÅ¿ion from Religion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. ThoÅ¿e who neglect Å¿ecret Duties have
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:191877:13"/>loÅ¿t one main evidence of Å¿incere worÅ¿hipping of God, not only becauÅ¿e they live in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of a known command of ChriÅ¿t, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.6. and not only becauÅ¿e they do decline from the uÅ¿ual practice of the godly, who are wont to perform theÅ¿e Å¿ecret duties daily morning and evening, and Å¿ometimes thrice a day, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 55.17, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10. but how is it poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible theÅ¿e can have an evidence of Å¿incere worÅ¿hipping of God, Å¿eeing they attend no worÅ¿hip but what is before men, and therefore muÅ¿t be judged to act the part of a Hypocrite, Å¿o our Saviour ChriÅ¿t reaÅ¿oneth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. ThoÅ¿e who neglect theÅ¿e Å¿ecret Duties, have loÅ¿t the Å¿enÅ¿e of perÅ¿onal, inward Soul-difficulties; for whoÅ¿oever feels in a broken-hearted manner, his Soul pinched and preÅ¿s'd with difficulties, he muÅ¿t and will have an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let by Å¿ecret Prayer, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.11. <hi>Behold he Prayeth,</hi> he embraceth Prayer not only as a duty, but as a gracious liberty; but amongÅ¿t his Soul difficulties, he ever finds Å¿ome which cannot be Å¿o particularly and expediently reached but by Å¿ecret Prayer, and calleth for a praying apart, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.14. but thoÅ¿e who neglect theÅ¿e Å¿ecret duties are paÅ¿t feeling of theÅ¿e difficulties, and as they feel no Å¿uch need of Å¿ecret prayer, Å¿o ChriÅ¿t paÅ¿Å¿eth by them, as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:191877:13"/>thoÅ¿e who have no work for ChriÅ¿t to do for them in Å¿ecret, and what will they do in that time, when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> like, they muÅ¿t turn their face towards the wall; and then if Å¿ecret prayer be not the means to take the laÅ¿t Å¿tep right, they fall into the everlaÅ¿ting pit, <hi>IÅ¿ai.</hi> 38.2.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. TheÅ¿e have loÅ¿t the preÅ¿ence of ChriÅ¿t in Å¿ecret; and as they have forÅ¿aken him in Å¿ecret, Å¿o he will forÅ¿ake them openly. There are many are very deÅ¿irous to hold the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ence of ChriÅ¿t openly, although they neglect his preÅ¿ence in Å¿ecret, but this cannot be, they have no promiÅ¿e and grounded hope of his preÅ¿ence openly, who do neglect the means of his preÅ¿ence in Å¿ecret, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.5. ApoÅ¿taÅ¿ie firÅ¿t beginneth in cloÅ¿ets and Å¿ecret places, and that which is in Å¿ecret, evil in the Å¿ight of God, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.9. and then behold greater, and more open abominations than theÅ¿e: And Å¿o we proceed to the Second.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A neglect of Family Duties; as Prayer in the Family morning and evening, and are of the number of thoÅ¿e Families which do not call upon the Name of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.25. or neglect reading the Word of God daily in the Family, or occaÅ¿ional repeating of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or of that daily inÅ¿tructing the Family
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:191877:14"/>by CatechiÅ¿ing or other profitable means as is commanded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.7. and this neglect is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Either total and are under the Å¿ame Å¿entence of wrath with the Heathen, and are heatheniÅ¿h Families, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.25.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or thoÅ¿e who are inconÅ¿tant in theÅ¿e Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties if prayer in the evening, yet none in the morning, or if prayer, yet have Å¿trangely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got that by Word and Prayer all is Å¿anctified, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. but the Å¿pecialty I intend in this is not Å¿o much to prove theÅ¿e to be duties, for who knoweth not this, who knoweth any thing of the Word of God, and of the practice of godly Families; but let us conÅ¿ider how far a neglect of theÅ¿e doth argue ApoÅ¿tacy from Religion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. TheÅ¿e want true Å¿anctified love to their Families; the natural love doth incline them to take care and provide for their Families in things of concernment to the outward Man, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. OtherwiÅ¿e they are worÅ¿e than an Infidel, and if they had true Å¿anctified love to their families, this would make them as readily to take care for their Families in their Soul concernments, and <hi>Abraham</hi>-like as a head of the Family, to inÅ¿truct, yea command an attendance to the great things of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. but theÅ¿e want natural affection truly Å¿anctified.</p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:191877:14"/>
                  <p n="2">2. TheÅ¿e want love to God, and to their own Souls.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They want love to God, for this would diÅ¿poÅ¿e them to a through care to bring up their Family in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.4.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They want love to their own Souls, its not poÅ¿Å¿ible for one to pitty his own Soul, but preÅ¿ently he will pitty and take care of the Souls of others, eÅ¿pecially of thoÅ¿e who are nearly related to him: if a MaÅ¿ter of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily be under a Å¿trong impreÅ¿Å¿ion, and a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel melting working of a Spirit of love to his own Soul, <hi>Ephraim</hi>-like to bemoan himÅ¿elf, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18. he will then need no other motive to make him pray in his Family, InÅ¿truct, Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiÅ¿e, and uÅ¿e all poÅ¿Å¿ible means for the good of his Family.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. TheÅ¿e want true love to Church and Common-wealth; they cannot but know that Å¿uch as Families are, Å¿uch at laÅ¿t the Church and Common-wealth muÅ¿t be. How can it be that a MaÅ¿ter of Family, who liveth in neglect of Family Duties, Å¿hould prove a true Friend to the purity and power of Religion in Church, or to a true pious Government in the Common wealth? he that will not Å¿erve God in his own HouÅ¿e, will not be a true Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant

                  <p>The third Particular followeth, and that is a neglect of private ChriÅ¿tian Meetings.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As thoÅ¿e Å¿et and Å¿olemn Meetings for Conference about the great things of God, and to pray together, and Å¿ometimes adding FaÅ¿ting and Prayer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or thoÅ¿e occaÅ¿ional Meetings of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tians, taking opportunities as they have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿ions one with another, to converÅ¿e about their Soul concerns.</p>
                  <p>And the neglect of theÅ¿e is either 1. Total; there are Å¿ome who have wholly forÅ¿aken theÅ¿e AÅ¿Å¿embling of themÅ¿elves together: or 2. If they hold up Å¿ome Å¿et Meetings; yet as to thoÅ¿e intimate DiÅ¿courÅ¿es, by laying toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their ObÅ¿ervations of the times, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Soul-concerns, as thoÅ¿e Jewels Å¿poken of in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. from theÅ¿e they are Strangers, and will give no heart-encouragement to other ChriÅ¿tians to come near to them, with intimate Conference about perÅ¿onal and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Experiences of the Lords dealing with them; and theÅ¿e know not what it meaneth to come into that broken hearted way of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:191877:15"/>one to another, their temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Å¿nares, and Soul-hazards, and that which is called by the ApoÅ¿tle a confeÅ¿Å¿ing of Faults one to another, and a praying one for another, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16.</p>
                  <p>But the Å¿pecialty likewiÅ¿e we intend in this, is to Å¿hew how far theÅ¿e neglects do argue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenÅ¿ions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. TheÅ¿e neglect a principal means of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical communion of ChriÅ¿tians, that wherein much of the life of it doth conÅ¿iÅ¿t; for pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical ChriÅ¿tian Communion cannot principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conÅ¿iÅ¿t in Apellations, and Titles, nor in meeting together at a Sacrament; but in caring one for another, as members of the Å¿ame body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.25. bearing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Burdens, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2. communicating one to another of Å¿piritual gifts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.11, 12. but thoÅ¿e Å¿olemn ChriÅ¿tian Meetings or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ional intimate DiÅ¿courÅ¿es, whereby ChriÅ¿tians are intimately acquainted with one anothers Burdens, and Soul-concerns; theÅ¿e lead into the life of practical communion, and where theÅ¿e ChriÅ¿tian Meetings fail, their communion vaniÅ¿heth into Names, Titles, or Å¿ome very powerleÅ¿s forms of communion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. TheÅ¿e do give place to many dangerous Temptations and diÅ¿tempers; for while they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:191877:16"/>live as Strangers from the Souls one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or any Å¿uch intimate ChriÅ¿tian Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences; the Tempter is at hand upon the leaÅ¿t occaÅ¿ion, to come in with uncharitable Å¿ugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tions, and to imploy any evil In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The next ConÅ¿ideration follows:</p>
                  <p>QueÅ¿t. <hi>How ApoÅ¿taÅ¿ie doth Å¿hew it Å¿elf in the neglect of publick WorÅ¿hip?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>AnÅ¿wer</hi> is, In neglect either of thoÅ¿e
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:191877:16"/>Ordinances which all are commanded to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, as publick Prayer, and hearing the Word of God Preached, and particularly of Sanctifying the Sabbath; Or a neglect of thoÅ¿e Ordinances which do properly belong to thoÅ¿e in Church Relation, and particularly in neglect of the Lords Supper and Church DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A neglect of thoÅ¿e publick Ordinances which all are commanded to attend, as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayer, and hearing the Word preached, and this neglect is, either.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Or attending upon the Ordinances in a Å¿lighty and Å¿leepy manner, not offering their

                  <p n="4">4. HaÅ¿tening a way upon unneceÅ¿Å¿ary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions before the laÅ¿t Prayer be ended, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the BleÅ¿Å¿ing be diÅ¿penÅ¿ed, not as thoÅ¿e who went not away before the Name of the Lord was put upon them, in a way of bleÅ¿Å¿ing by the Lords MeÅ¿Å¿enger, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.26, 27. More particularly this neglect doth Å¿hew it Å¿elf and ApoÅ¿taÅ¿ie therein, in the neglect of Sanctifying the Sabbath; and that is either,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In neglecting to prepare for the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath by a timely breaking off from worldly OccaÅ¿ions, but do run on to the very time of the beginning of the Sabbath, to that in their Worldly concerns, their foot Å¿teppeth into the time of the Sabbath, or Å¿o nigh to it that they cannot prepare for holy time, and the Duties of the Å¿ame Å¿o Å¿uddenly, <hi>IÅ¿ai.</hi> 58.13.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or in the time of the Sabbath, a neglect to Sanctifie the Holy time, having forgot to practice that which is Å¿o plainly declared: Call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, and honourable, and Å¿halt honour him, not doing thine own wayes, not finding thine own pleaÅ¿ure, not Å¿peaking thine own words, <hi>IÅ¿ai.</hi> 58.13.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As Å¿oon as the Sabbath is ended, thoÅ¿e who do fall into vain and unprofitable diÅ¿cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es,

                  <p>But let us likewiÅ¿e in this conÅ¿ider how far theÅ¿e neglects do argue a declenÅ¿ion from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. TheÅ¿e who do neglect the publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip, and particularly the Sabbath, do fall Å¿hort of that ReligiouÅ¿neÅ¿s which many Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and meer FormaliÅ¿ts do attain, for theÅ¿e in the publick WorÅ¿hip of God, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themÅ¿elves as the Lords People are wont to do, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31, 32. <hi>Many have the form of Religion and not the power,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.5. <hi>Many have the letter of WorÅ¿hip and not the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 2.28. but thoÅ¿e who have not the form, the letter, and external part of worÅ¿hip are far off from the power, the Å¿pirit and inward worÅ¿hipping of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. TheÅ¿e do by their practice Å¿ay, that the worÅ¿hip of God is a burden, and an abhorring to them, their loathneÅ¿s to come to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick WorÅ¿hip, their weariÅ¿ome Behaviour in the time of it, and their haÅ¿tening from it do
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:191877:18"/>teÅ¿tifie to their faces, that the Sabbath, and the Word of the Lord is a burden to them, and theÅ¿e are a burden to the Lord, and he threatens to forget them, to forÅ¿ake them, and to caÅ¿t them out of his preÅ¿ence, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.39.40. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.27. theÅ¿e by their works do Å¿ay, their Souls have abhorred God; and the Lord he Å¿aith he hath abhorred them, and that he will not feed them; but that which dieth let it die, and let the reÅ¿t eat the fleÅ¿h one of another, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.8, 9.</p>
                  <p>The Å¿econd follows, and that is the neglect of thoÅ¿e Ordinances which do properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to thoÅ¿e in Church Relation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A neglect of preparing for, and of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take hold of the Covenant, <hi>IÅ¿ai.</hi> 58.4.5 not as thoÅ¿e whoÅ¿e faces are Zionward, and weeping they will go to Å¿eek the Lord, and joyn themÅ¿elves in a perpetual Covenant ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be forgotten, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.4, 5. but thoÅ¿e who turn their backs upon the viÅ¿ible Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the adminiÅ¿trations of it, do by their practice diÅ¿own God, and Å¿ay, the true God is not their God; for how can God be their God, but by Covenant; and what is the Church Covenant, but an AdminiÅ¿tration of the Covenant of Grace: and that Soul who doth by words or works, by opinion or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiÅ¿e
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:191877:18"/>turn away from the Covenant, by negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting to prepare for it, or take hold of it, is a Å¿tranger from the Covenant, and liveth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. and if by his Parentage and Birth, he is in viÅ¿ible Covenant, and when grown up, yet doeth neglect to look after it, or take hold of it, he doth by his practiÅ¿e deÅ¿piÅ¿e his Birth right; and the time may come when he may Å¿eek for a BleÅ¿Å¿ing with tears, and yet find no place of Repentance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16, 17.</p>

                  <p>And we who are in Church Å¿tate, being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by our Pious Rulers, with other Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations in this Colony, and in ConÅ¿eience of our duty moved to Å¿eek the Lord by FaÅ¿ting and Prayer: and having conÅ¿idered the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars contained in the Writing Å¿ent from our Rulers to the Å¿everal Churches in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, and which we ought to keep in Record for Å¿ucceeding Generations, in which they do advertiÅ¿e us of thoÅ¿e Å¿ins, for which the fierce

                  <p>ARguments Grounded upon the Word of God, to prove that the FirÅ¿t Day of the Week is by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Appointment the Day Å¿epara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Holy WorÅ¿hip, and ought to be kept Holy unto the Lord, according to the Rules of Sanctifying the Sabbath, and conÅ¿equently the CeÅ¿Å¿ation of the Å¿eventh Day Sabbath in theÅ¿e GoÅ¿pel Dayes.</p>
                  <p>And then a Reply to <hi>John Rogers</hi> his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wers to Å¿ome QueÅ¿tions Å¿ent to him from the Honourable Governour of <hi>Connecticut;</hi> and likewiÅ¿e an AnÅ¿wer to <hi>John R.</hi> his Å¿even Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tions with which he concluded.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Arguments, the QueÅ¿tion is not now concerning the Name, whether to be called a ChriÅ¿tian Sabbath, which Å¿ome take to be Analogically a reÅ¿emblance to the <hi>JewiÅ¿h Sabbath;</hi> or whither to be called the Lords Day, which Å¿ome have thought to be a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:191877:45"/>more GoÅ¿pel Name. But the Subject of our DiÅ¿courÅ¿e at this time, is not concerning the Name but the thing, and far be it from me to imagine that I can add any thing to, or do Å¿o well as thoÅ¿e Worthies, Doctor <hi>Bound,</hi> Mr. <hi>Abbot,</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> &amp; Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> and others have done in their Learned Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate DiÅ¿courÅ¿es upon this Subject, only I Å¿hall take Å¿ome Arguments which to me Å¿eem moÅ¿t Å¿uitable to my preÅ¿ent purpoÅ¿e.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firÅ¿t is from <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. in which the ApoÅ¿tle declared, <hi>that he was in the Spirit on the Lords Day:</hi> For the opening of which words to make way for the Argument we may ConÅ¿ider:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> It was Å¿ome particular Day in the week, which the ApoÅ¿tle calls the Lords Day: for his Scope is to notifie at what particular time he had the ViÅ¿ions and Revelations of Å¿o great concernment to all the Churches in all Ages to the end of the World, and this he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Lords Day:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> Which was either Å¿ome particular day, or Å¿ome general name applicable to any day of divine ViÅ¿ion, if Å¿o then the anÅ¿wer Å¿hould be the Å¿ame with the QueÅ¿tion, and prove and make evident nothing, for the queÅ¿tion is what day he had theÅ¿e divine viÅ¿ions
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:191877:45"/>and the AnÅ¿wer then Å¿hould be in the day of divine ViÅ¿ions, far be it from us to think that the ApoÅ¿tle guided by the Spirit of God in every word he Å¿aid, could Å¿peak Å¿uch nonÅ¿ence: therefore it muÅ¿t be underÅ¿tood of Å¿ome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular day in the week.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It was Å¿ome particular Day well known to the Churches of ChriÅ¿t to whom he wrote, by that name of the Lords Day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> For it was a Day well known to the Churches by the name of the Lords Day, or elÅ¿e unknown and obÅ¿cure, and would want an ExpoÅ¿ition; far be it likewiÅ¿e from us to think that the ApoÅ¿tle guided by the Spirit of God, and having undertaken to make known to the Churches in what particular Day he had thoÅ¿e Divine Revelations, Å¿hould put an obÅ¿cure and unknown name upon the Day by which the Churches could not know what he meant; therefore it is to be underÅ¿tood of a particular day well known to the Churches of ChriÅ¿t.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This particular Day Å¿o well known to the Churches by the name of the Lords Day, was a Day of divine InÅ¿titution a Holy Day:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> For it is called the Lords Day, either becauÅ¿e it was a day of divine Revelation, or a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:191877:46"/>Day by divine InÅ¿titution; but it was not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Lords Day, becauÅ¿e it was a day of divine Revelation, for as we heard before, this would be to Å¿peak nonÅ¿enÅ¿e, and nothing to the QueÅ¿tion, therefore it was called the Lords Day, becauÅ¿e it was Å¿o by divine InÅ¿titution, and Å¿o a Holy Day.</p>
                  <p>Take one <hi>Argument</hi> more for the clearing of this, That which is honoured by the Holy GhoÅ¿t in the ApoÅ¿tle, with the Å¿ame honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and holy Title and Name as belongs to the Lords Supper, and other holy InÅ¿titutions is holy as theÅ¿e are.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> The reaÅ¿on is, for if the Holy GhoÅ¿t Å¿hould honour this particular Day with as Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred a Name of Honour, as Ordinances are, and yet not be a holy Day, it would be to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour it above its due, and conÅ¿equently to degrade other divine InÅ¿titutions, but this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, but the day Å¿poken of hath the Å¿ame honourable title and name, as the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the Word of the Lord. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the particular Day well known to the Churches of ChriÅ¿t, called by the Å¿ame honourable and holy Title or Name, as the Lords Supper is, and other holy InÅ¿titutions was the firÅ¿t day of the week.</p>
                  <p>And for the Proof of this, let us conÅ¿ider
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:191877:46"/>Arguments of all Å¿orts, inartificial, and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial abundantly confirmed by the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, Light and Evidence.</p>

                     <hi>Arg.</hi> The ApoÅ¿tle calls the Day as it was by the Lord made, and as it is, or elÅ¿e he did miÅ¿cal it; the firÅ¿t part of this disjunct Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ition muÅ¿t be granted, that the ApoÅ¿tle did call the Day as it is, as the Lord had made,

                  <p>And that which Å¿ome have mentioned in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.27. hath likewiÅ¿e its weight, that

                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> Take the Argument from hence, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this was performed literally, or typically, if literally, then the eighth day which is our firÅ¿t day of the week, was Honoured and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified above the Å¿eventh day, and tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And that day of his ReÅ¿urrection was the day of performing that great promiÅ¿e and prophecie, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten thee,</hi> for thus its expounded by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿te, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.33.

                  </p>
                  <p>For although ChriÅ¿t is the Son of God from everlaÅ¿ting, yet this was the day in which he was declared to be the Son of God by ReÅ¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. and the firÅ¿t day of the week was the very day for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this promiÅ¿e, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5. as <hi>Pareus</hi>

                  <p>And to conclude this, and though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect that thoÅ¿e who are under a penal blindneÅ¿s and deafneÅ¿s, will either give or take reaÅ¿on until the Lord Å¿hall give them an ear to hear, and an eye to Å¿ee, and becauÅ¿e they Å¿ay they Å¿ee their Å¿in remaineth, <hi>John</hi> 9 41.

                  <p>The day called the <hi>Lords Day</hi> is Å¿ome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular day well known to the Churches of ChriÅ¿t, otherwiÅ¿e it was in vain, and to no purpoÅ¿e for the ApoÅ¿tles to have Å¿poken a word of the Day.</p>
                  <p>And this day called the Lords day was a Holy Day, otherwiÅ¿e it could not have the holy name proper unto holy things and holy time.</p>
                  <p>And that the day called the <hi>Lords Day</hi> is the firÅ¿t day of the week, this hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved both by the TeÅ¿timonies of all Churches in all ages, though cavelled againÅ¿t by Å¿ome in late times, yet this their TeÅ¿timony may well paÅ¿s for legal TeÅ¿timony in any Court of JuÅ¿tice upon Earth, and they who oppoÅ¿e it
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:191877:49"/>muÅ¿t be legally condemned for Liars.</p>
                  <p>And more then all this it hath been infallably proved by the Word of God, and his Works, that the firÅ¿t day of the Week is the very day which the Lord by his Prophets foretold he would make to be the day in which above all other dayes we Å¿hould rejoyce, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 118 24.</p>
                  <p>And with his Almighty hand he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it by the working of his mighty power which he wrought in ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us when he raiÅ¿ed him from the dead, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.20. And in this very day revealing himÅ¿elf to his DiÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as the exalted head of his Church and People. And in this very day CommiÅ¿Å¿ion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ApoÅ¿tles, and breathing the Holy GhoÅ¿t in the Å¿ame day upon them, to impower and enable them in all things reÅ¿pecting their work as ApoÅ¿tles of ChriÅ¿t, and particularly by the Holy GhoÅ¿t guiding the ApoÅ¿tles to Å¿ettle the firÅ¿t day of the Week in all the Churches of ChriÅ¿t, as it is the Lords day and our ChriÅ¿tian Sabbath: but more of this in that which followeth.</p>
                  <p>And thus that which the Lord hath wrought according to his Word, may well paÅ¿s or divine TeÅ¿timony in the Court of ConÅ¿ecience, that the firÅ¿t day of the week is by Divine
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:191877:50"/>InÅ¿titution the Lords Day, and our ChriÅ¿tian Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>And now let us proceed in the Å¿econd place to prove that the firÅ¿t day of the week, which the Lord hath made by his word and works to be the Lords Day and our ChriÅ¿tian Sabbath, was Å¿ettled by the ApoÅ¿tles in all the Churches in the primitive time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> By their Doctrine, <hi>Secondly,</hi> By their Practice.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By their Doctrine, for for the clearing of this, let us conÅ¿ider; <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.8.9.</p>
                  <p>Where the ApoÅ¿tle doth by his Doctrine inform us of a ReÅ¿t which remaineth to the People of God, and another day of ReÅ¿t; and to make way for the Argument, let us open that Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> he Å¿peaks of a SabbatiÅ¿m, Å¿o the Word in the Original is, a ReÅ¿t reÅ¿embled by the Å¿eventh day ReÅ¿t, Å¿poken of in the third and fourth verÅ¿es, and by the ReÅ¿t in the Land of Canaan mentioned in the Å¿eventh and eighth verÅ¿es.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:191877:50"/>had reÅ¿pect, did Å¿peak of another ReÅ¿t, and a day of ReÅ¿t which is neither the Å¿eventh day ReÅ¿t, nor the ReÅ¿t in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but Å¿ignified and exemplified by the one, and Å¿ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed out by the other and the ApoÅ¿tles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monÅ¿tration of this Doctrine may be expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ad sjunctive SyllogiÅ¿me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> Either it is of the firÅ¿t reÅ¿t of God in which he ceaÅ¿ed from the Works of Creation or of that reÅ¿t in <hi>Canaan,</hi> or of Å¿ome other reÅ¿t, and of another day of reÅ¿t, but not of the two former; and therefore the concluÅ¿ion of the ApoÅ¿tle is in the 8th and 9th verÅ¿es of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sabbath of reÅ¿t.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This reÅ¿t, and day of reÅ¿t Å¿poken of by the ApoÅ¿tle remaineth, Å¿o it is expreÅ¿s in the words of the 9th verÅ¿e, which remaining pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, belongs to this reÅ¿t, intimating by this his Doctrine, that the other reÅ¿t, the Å¿eventh day reÅ¿t is removed, for the remaining Å¿igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the Å¿tability and permanency of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pel reÅ¿t, and the day of that reÅ¿t, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of the thing Å¿haken, that thoÅ¿e things which cannot be Å¿haken may remain, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.27. The reÅ¿t on the Å¿eventh day, and that day of reÅ¿t was miÅ¿erably Å¿haken by the Å¿in and fall of man, which brought the CurÅ¿e not only upon himÅ¿elf and his PoÅ¿terity, but upon
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:191877:51"/>the works of Creation; and therefore the Lord did not only threaten to deÅ¿troy Man, but likewiÅ¿e to deÅ¿troy the BeaÅ¿ts, the Creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, and the Fowls of the Air; for Å¿aith the Lord, it repenteth me that I have made them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.7.</p>
                  <p>Thus was the Å¿eventh dayes Sabbath which was a memorial of Gods reÅ¿ting from, and complacency in his works of Creation, Å¿ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Mans Å¿in, and Gods curÅ¿e upon the Creatures becauÅ¿e of Man, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment for the Å¿anctifying the Å¿eventh dayes Sabbath did remain as a hand-writing againÅ¿t Å¿inful and fallen Man, as other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Hand-writings did, until ChriÅ¿t comes and brings in better Ordinances, and a better day of reÅ¿t which remaineth as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tle by his Doctrine inÅ¿tructeth us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The ReÅ¿t and day of ReÅ¿t which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is that into which ChriÅ¿t firÅ¿t entred, and at length did perfectly poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s, and into which he leadeth his People, but ChriÅ¿t entred into his reÅ¿t the firÅ¿t day of the week, when he roÅ¿e from the dead, and at length he paÅ¿Å¿ed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the full poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of the ManÅ¿ions and reÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. and he that entred into his reÅ¿t ceaÅ¿ed from his Works as God did from his, <hi>ver.</hi> 10.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. The remaining of this day of ReÅ¿t is Å¿poken of in the preÅ¿ent tenÅ¿e; it is Å¿aid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there remaineth a ReÅ¿t, Å¿o that it is that which at preÅ¿ent the people of God do poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s although the perfection of it is reÅ¿erved for them when they Å¿hall come to the ManÅ¿ions prepared by ChriÅ¿t for them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.2, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. the words being thus opened the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment now follows.</p>

                     <hi>Arg.</hi> That if the People of God have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day of ReÅ¿t which is not the Å¿eventh day reÅ¿t, but that which ChriÅ¿t doth lead them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by his own Example, and by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him who entred into his reÅ¿t in the firÅ¿t day of the week, then the firÅ¿t day of the week is the day of our GoÅ¿pel ReÅ¿t, and of our ChriÅ¿tian Sabbath, and conÅ¿equently a ceÅ¿Å¿ation of the Å¿eventh dayes Sabbath; but the proof of all theÅ¿e particulars we have in the former: and concerning ChriÅ¿ts entring into his ReÅ¿t on the firÅ¿t day of the Week, I Å¿hall yet Å¿peak more fully concerning that as I Å¿hall meet with it in Å¿ome of the Objections of <hi>John Rogers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Å¿econd place, to prove that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles by their Doctrine did Å¿ettle the firÅ¿t day of the week to be our ChriÅ¿tian Sabbath, we may Å¿ee in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.12.</p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:191877:52"/>
                  <p n="1">1. That which is there expreÅ¿t is by way of precept and injunction, for Å¿o the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aith, he had given order concerning the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the Saints, and therefore not left it as a matter of indifferency or liberty, but whoÅ¿oever did neglect this, did tranÅ¿greÅ¿s the ApoÅ¿tolical precept and order.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This order for the collection for the Saints was not only Å¿ent to the Churches at <hi>Corinth,</hi> but to the Churches at <hi>Galatia,</hi> Å¿o that it was an order and injunction common to the Churches:</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The order did not only reÅ¿pect the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection it Å¿elf, but the time and day of it, that upon the firÅ¿t day of the week, let every one lay by him in Å¿tore, as God hath proÅ¿pered him: Å¿o it is expreÅ¿s in the 2<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> verÅ¿e, now the Argument follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> The firÅ¿t day of the week was either a common and indifferent day, or a holy day, the day of the ChriÅ¿tian Sabbath, but no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and indifferent day; for how could the ApoÅ¿tle by his injunction and order, make it neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the Churches to attend this work of mercy, collection for the Saints on the firÅ¿t day of the week, if it was but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon day, and thus eÅ¿teem one common day above another contrary to his Doctrine, <hi>Rom.</hi>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:191877:52"/>14.5. far be it from us to think that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tle could Å¿o contradict his own Doctrine, but it was becauÅ¿e the firÅ¿t day of the week was made to be a holy day, and Å¿uch works of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy are very Å¿uitable unto the day.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Arg.</hi> Or thus, the ApoÅ¿tle did order collection for the Saints to be on the firÅ¿t day of the week, either becauÅ¿e it was the ChriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Sabbath, or for Å¿ome other reaÅ¿ons, but I have Å¿o long waited to he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>r of Å¿ome other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons, why the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿hould lay an injunction upon all Churches to have Å¿uch an honourable reÅ¿pect to this day, without any conÅ¿ideration of it as the Lords Day and ChriÅ¿tian Sabbath, and all the Objectors and Cavillers againÅ¿t the firÅ¿t day of the week the Lords day, have not brought forth the leaÅ¿t appearance of any reaÅ¿on to the contrary, that I confeÅ¿s I begin to think, that the Opponents themÅ¿elves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themÅ¿elves, have received a Sentence of deÅ¿pair of giving any reaÅ¿on, only they have travelled and brought forth one poor Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that there is not a word Å¿poken of a Sabbath here, and who Å¿aith there is? but the Argument is taken from the ApoÅ¿tles Order, and by ApoÅ¿tolical Order advanced the firÅ¿t day of the week above any other day, and that the reaÅ¿on of this is, either becauÅ¿e it is the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:191877:53"/>day of the ChriÅ¿tian Sabbath or for Å¿ome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaÅ¿on which never yet was brought to light, and therefore we conclude as in the former that the ApoÅ¿tle by his Doctrine did Å¿ettle the firÅ¿t day of the week to be a holy day, a ChriÅ¿tian Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>Now in the next place, concerning the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the ApoÅ¿tles &amp; the practice of the Churches, of which much may be Å¿aid in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their attendance to holy Duties in the firÅ¿t day of the week, becauÅ¿e it was a day Å¿eparated for holy WorÅ¿hip, but at preÅ¿ent we may conÅ¿ider <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> it was a Church aÅ¿Å¿embly there Å¿poken of, for it is Å¿aid the DiÅ¿ciples came together.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the end for the Å¿ake of which they came together, it was for the Å¿ake of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duties, that they might partake of the Lords Supper called breaking of Bread in this place, as in <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. and did not go alone without other Religious performances, <hi>viz.</hi> Prayer and hearing the Word Preached.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is Å¿poken of as a cuÅ¿tom, and uÅ¿uall practice of the DiÅ¿ciples, therefore it is Å¿aid on the firÅ¿t day of the week when the DiÅ¿ciples came together. <hi>Paul</hi> having wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for and taking this opportunity to Preach to them, for he abode Å¿even dayes among them, but this was the laÅ¿t day, his being
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:191877:53"/>ready to depart on the morrow, as is expreÅ¿t in the 7th verÅ¿e.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> Hence the Argument is, <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>DiÅ¿ciples</hi> with him either kept the Seventh day Sabbath or the firÅ¿t day of the week a ChriÅ¿tian Sabbath, or elÅ¿e they kept no Sabbath at all, if they had kept the Å¿eventh day Sabbath, that was the day before this FirÅ¿t day of the Week, then they had a meeting after a Sabbath manner for Religious Duties, then the EvangeliÅ¿t would not have Å¿poken of this Meeting on the FirÅ¿t day as the only Church Meeting of the Å¿even dayes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tles abode amongÅ¿t them; therefore it was the firÅ¿t day of the Week in which <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>DiÅ¿ciples</hi> aÅ¿Å¿embled, and kept as a ChriÅ¿tian Sabbath.</p>

                     <hi>AnÅ¿.</hi> His AnÅ¿wer is before, Å¿aying not that I know the Ordinance of the Sabbath is reÅ¿t to Man and BeaÅ¿t, for Å¿o God ordained in the fourth Command after the Å¿ix dayes work to reÅ¿t.</p>
                  <p>Qu. 8, <hi>Are not ChriÅ¿t and his ApoÅ¿tles therein to be a pattern for ChriÅ¿tians to follow, and Å¿o vertually a divine InÅ¿titution?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>AnÅ¿. Iohn Rogers</hi> his AnÅ¿wer is, that the eighth QueÅ¿tion is anÅ¿wered by the AnÅ¿wer to the Å¿eventh, and the anÅ¿wer to the Å¿eventh was the Å¿ame with the AnÅ¿wer to the Å¿ixth, <hi>viz.</hi> that he could not tell, that he did not know, and thus he makes a quick diÅ¿patch of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wers
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:191877:60"/>to the Governours QueÅ¿tions: But in this he is like thoÅ¿e who when the QueÅ¿tion was asked them concerning the BaptiÅ¿me of <hi>John,</hi> whence was it, from Heaven or of Men? they reaÅ¿oned with themÅ¿elves Å¿aying, if we Å¿hall Å¿ay from Heaven he will Å¿ay unto us, why did you not then believe him? but if we Å¿hall Å¿ay of Men, we fear the People, for all hold <hi>John</hi> as a Prophet, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.25, 26. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they concluded it was Å¿afeÅ¿t for them to Å¿ay we cannot tell, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. Thus likewiÅ¿e if <hi>Iohn</hi> R. Å¿hould Å¿ay, that the Patern and the Examples of the ApoÅ¿tles, reÅ¿pecting Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip, and particularly concerning the Sabbath, ought to be followed, then he knows it would be Å¿aid, why do you not follow them? and if he Å¿hould Å¿ay, that their Example ought not to be followed by ChriÅ¿tians, this would be Å¿o un-GoÅ¿pel-like and un-ChriÅ¿tian like, and therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> R. concludes it is beÅ¿t for him to Å¿ay he cannot tell.</p>
                  <p>Qu. 9. <hi>If the old JewiÅ¿h Covenant be expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and Å¿undry Ordinances about time and place,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>altred, why not the time of the old Sabbath alterable by the Lord of the Sabbath upon a GoÅ¿pel account as a memorial of Redemption?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>AnÅ¿. Iohn R.</hi> his AnÅ¿wer is, I know not what thou doÅ¿t mean by old JewiÅ¿h Covenant,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:191877:60"/>I know no Covenant in Scripture by that name, if thou doÅ¿t mean the Covenant which the two Tables of Stone, the Tables of the Covenant which did contain the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments which <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> did enter into a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, by engaging to perform the Å¿ame, which Covenant they brake, and peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hed in the WilderneÅ¿s for the Å¿ame; God did ordain by the hand of <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> Ceremonies as a figure of the MediatorÅ¿hip of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t at this time at <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> when <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> entred into the Covenant of works, to Å¿hew that there was mercy to be obtained by JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, though the firÅ¿t Covenant was broken by them; that is to Å¿ay, upon Repentance and Faith. Now though the firÅ¿t Covenant which was dedicated with the blood of Bulls and Goats, and accompanied with many Rites and Ceremonies which were figures of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torÅ¿hip of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, which Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are done away, but none of them placed in the two Tables, for that Law is Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and it is as eaÅ¿ie by Gods Decree, for Heaven and Earth to paÅ¿s as for a tittle of it to fail: Now the other Law contained in the former Covenant, called the Hand-writing of Ordinances, which was nailed to the CroÅ¿s of ChriÅ¿t, which did contain meats and drinks,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:191877:61"/>New Moons and Sabbaths, which Sabbaths was beÅ¿ides the Sabbaths of the Lord, but Gods Å¿eventh day-Sabbaths were commanded by the mouth of the Lord with an audible voice, written with the finger of God in Stone, death inflicted upon the breaker of it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.12.</p>

                     <hi>Reply,</hi> The Reply is this, <hi>John Rogers</hi> his AnÅ¿wer is full of confuÅ¿ion, jombling the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works and the Covenant of Grace together.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> The Covenant of Works was made with <hi>Adam.</hi>

                  <p>Whether another day might not be more Å¿uitable upon a GoÅ¿pel account than the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day Sabbath? and what reaÅ¿on doth <hi>Iohn</hi> R. give to the contrary?

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:191877:61"/>Arguments himÅ¿elf, I Å¿hall leave them as I find them covered with darkneÅ¿s and void of form; but if there be any face of reaÅ¿on in this his AnÅ¿wer, at length it is, That the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day being commanded in the Decalogue is therefore unalterable: but we have proved that ChriÅ¿t hath altered it, and by the Holy GhoÅ¿t guided his ApoÅ¿tles to Å¿ettle the firÅ¿t Day of the Week the Lords Day and our ChriÅ¿tian Sabbath: and becauÅ¿e I Å¿hall meet with this Objection more fully in the next AnÅ¿wer, I proceed to that.</p>

                     <hi>AnÅ¿.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply: Iohn</hi> R. in this AnÅ¿wer is fled to his Å¿eeming Fort, and he knows if he be driven out from this, that neither he nor any for the Å¿eventh dayes Sabbath, have any CaÅ¿tle nor Covering for their conceited confidence, but the Å¿cope of the QueÅ¿tion if rightly Å¿tated and plainly expreÅ¿Å¿ed is.</p>
                  <p>That a Sabbath as a Sabbath is firÅ¿t and laÅ¿t in the Precept, and Å¿hall not be changed, but the particular day is Å¿econdarily Å¿pecified, and is mutable as other poÅ¿itive Laws are, the Lord having reÅ¿erved a liberty to himÅ¿elf to change them according to his Royal pleaÅ¿ure, and who Å¿hall Å¿ay he hath done iniquity? And as for <hi>Iohn</hi> R. his Argument, Å¿o far as it hath any colour of reaÅ¿on in it, is. That Å¿eeing ChriÅ¿t came not to deÅ¿troy the Law but to fulfil it, and that in every jot and tittle of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to change the Å¿eventh dayes Sabbath into the firÅ¿t day of the Week, and to this we Å¿hall poÅ¿itively and plainly Reply.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> There is that which may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an actual fulfilling in all and every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar point and duty required in the Decalogue, but ChriÅ¿t did never actually fulfil the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Duties of Parents to Children of a HuÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:191877:63"/>to a WiÅ¿e and many other particular points and duties contained in the Decalogue and yet his fulfilling all and every one of thoÅ¿e Duties which had any Å¿uitableneÅ¿s to his Å¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and work, as he had opportunity in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God or Man, this is called a fulfilling of all righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is an actual fulfilling of the Law literally; and in this Å¿ence the PrieÅ¿t in his Labour in Sabbath duties of his Office, might be Å¿aid to prophane the Sabbath, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.5.</p>
                  <p>And a fulfilling Å¿piritually and finally accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the true Å¿cope of the Law, and thus he was Å¿aid to be blameleÅ¿s, and Å¿o may we, if we keep that day holy which ChriÅ¿t hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as moÅ¿t Å¿uitable to GoÅ¿pel times and the moÅ¿t Å¿piritual Å¿cope of the fourth Command, although we prophane the Å¿eventh day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To come nearer to the Text mentioned, ChriÅ¿t came not to make any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tructive change of the Law but to fulfil it; and therefore to make a perfecting or perÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive change: And the Godly, Learned do note that the word to deÅ¿troy the Law Å¿igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to diÅ¿Å¿olve or pull it in pieces, ChriÅ¿t came not to diÅ¿Å¿olve or pull the Law in pieces, and

R.</hi> as he Å¿eemeth to intimate, let him credit <hi>Beza</hi> in this matter alÅ¿o, who atteÅ¿teth that in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:191877:64"/>an ancient Copy he had found it thus Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That the ApoÅ¿tle had given order for the Collections in the firÅ¿t day of the week with this added the Lords Day, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2.</p>
                  <p>But Å¿eeing this <hi>Judaizer</hi> and others of his perÅ¿waÅ¿ion have Å¿o wreÅ¿ted this Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17. we Å¿hall add one conÅ¿ideration more for the clearing of the Å¿ame, and our Argument is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> As ChriÅ¿t came to fulfil the Law, Å¿o likewiÅ¿e he came to fulfil the Prophets, Å¿o it is expreÅ¿Å¿ed in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17. <hi>think not</hi> Å¿aith ChriÅ¿t, <hi>that I am come to deÅ¿troy the Law or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, I am not come to deÅ¿troy but to fulfil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ChriÅ¿t did fulfil the Prophets, their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies by performing and anÅ¿wering the Å¿cope and end of the Å¿ame, and by changing the Prophecies into performances: Oh moÅ¿t happy and glorious change, without which the Prophets their Prophecies could not have been fulfilled! this was far off from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tructive change of one jott or tittle of the Prophecies.</p>
                  <p>So likewiÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t did fulfil the Law, and particularly that Law the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by performing and anÅ¿wering the Å¿cope and end of it, and by changing not the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath as a Sabbath, but by changing of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath from the Å¿eventh day to the firÅ¿t day of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:191877:64"/>the week, and this was no deÅ¿tructive change of one jott or tittle of the fourth Command, but a moÅ¿t happy and glorious change with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect to the glory of the Law-giver, and the good of his People, which bleÅ¿Å¿ed ends are more fully and perfectly attained by the change, than could poÅ¿Å¿ibly be by a Å¿eventh day Sabbath, as is more fully explicated in my CatechiÅ¿m; Å¿o that the fourth Command complains not, it is wronged not a jott, or tittle of it deÅ¿troyed, no more than when veÅ¿Å¿els of BraÅ¿s or Earthen VeÅ¿Å¿els are turned into Gold and that which is leÅ¿s perfect is turned into that which is more perfect, for though the Law of God is ever perfect as to the time and Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for whom it is fitted, and Å¿o as the Å¿eventh day Sabbath as it reÅ¿pected the time and Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for whom it was fitted, but yet when the firÅ¿t day of the week is appointed by the Lord of the Sabbath as moÅ¿t Å¿uitable to GoÅ¿pel times, and the Å¿ubjects of GoÅ¿pel AdminiÅ¿tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; now that which was leÅ¿s perfect reÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting this time and Å¿tate moÅ¿t give place to that which is more perfect, and in this the fourth Command is not deÅ¿troyed but fulfilled, the Law being no Enemy to the GoÅ¿pel, but like <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> do kiÅ¿s one another upon the Mount of the Lord, and thus doth the fourth

                     <hi>Reply,</hi> The Reply to <hi>John Rogers</hi> his long AnÅ¿wer, and to the eleventh Querie, I can find in this his AnÅ¿wer, neither Divinity nor Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, neither good ReaÅ¿on, nor good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; but a throng of abÅ¿urdities and incivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities: and as Å¿oon as they are brought near the Light their monÅ¿trous deformities will be made manifeÅ¿t to any man who hath not a blaÅ¿t upon his reaÅ¿on.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> The Word of God Å¿aith, that we ought to follow peace with all Men, and holineÅ¿s, without which no man Å¿hall Å¿ee the Lord <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>John</hi> R. pretending holineÅ¿s proceedeth to diÅ¿turb the peace EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tick, and Civil, of Pious Rulers and Godly People, and appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to God for a Judgement, like thoÅ¿e in <hi>IÅ¿ai.</hi> 48.3, 4. who Å¿aid <hi>they would truÅ¿t in God,</hi> but they were rebellious, and their Brow as BraÅ¿s and Neck as an iron Sinew.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He denies that all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of ChriÅ¿t do keep the firÅ¿t day of the week, as it is the Lords Day, and aÅ¿Å¿erteth the contrary: but if <hi>J. R.</hi> knows of any Church in antient times or of late times, it is pity he doth not help thoÅ¿e of his PerÅ¿waÅ¿ion who have been Å¿o often chalenged to mention one
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:191877:67"/>Church of ChriÅ¿t in former times, or one Writer, or one ChriÅ¿tian, or one Heretick, who did gainÅ¿ay this until late times: But if <hi>J.

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God and his People hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿en our Governour to be a Judge, but <hi>J.

But <hi>I.

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:191877:68"/>And as for his aÅ¿perÅ¿ing Complaints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the Government, for proceeding againÅ¿t him, I have no call: nor is there any need for me to take the defence of our Rulers, they are well able to defend themÅ¿elves, and will in due time clear their exceeding lenity towards <hi>John Rogers</hi> and their legal proceedings, and wipe away all his reviling AÅ¿perÅ¿ions; and what hath been done by the MiniÅ¿ters and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ChriÅ¿tians for the conviction of <hi>I.

                  <p>So that means of Conviction are to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved with reÅ¿pect to the hope of good fruit but what the fruit hath been of the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of means upon <hi>Iohn R.</hi> is known to any who knows <hi>Iohn Rogers.</hi>

                  <p>But the contrary to theÅ¿e is an AntichriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Spirit, when Å¿o far from avoiding offence, that there is a catching at an opportunity to lay a Å¿tumbling block in the way, not only of

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He that doth all the former under a pretence of ConverÅ¿ion work, having been notoriouÅ¿ly Å¿candalous in his life; and as Å¿oon as he pretends to be converted, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ently leaps into AntichriÅ¿tian-practices and
